This is supposed to be a minimal web app containing many of the concepts and considerations going into a production webapp. 

Namely:

Performance considerations and seo (server side rendering , preload, async, defer, bundle size analysis, bundle splitting)
Offline and shaky connection tolerance
Component reusability and organization considerations (fully reusable components, development using react-storybook, components as styling units using inline styles, modularized redux with redux ducks)
State management considerations (redux, redux-thunk)
Client-side routing with react-router
Testing 

This app was written to allow me to play around with concepts I have been reading about, without being bogged down by the specific details of a bigger and functionalitywise more interesting app.


// Look into Helmet and time travel debugging, sentry, maybe e2e testing with cypress
